## 📌 Overview

This project is an AI-driven web application designed to evaluate visa eligibility using intelligent reasoning instead of traditional rule-based logic.

The system analyzes user-provided details, retrieves relevant immigration policies, and generates a decision with a clear explanation using an AI model integrated via **Groq API**.

## 🎯 Objective

* Build an intelligent eligibility screening system
* Use real-world policy data for decision making
* Replace static conditions with AI reasoning
* Deliver a complete end-to-end deployed application

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

The system follows a **Retrieval + AI reasoning pipeline**:

* Collect structured user input
* Retrieve relevant policy data from vector database
* Combine both inputs
* Generate decision using AI model

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is organized into distinct layers for better scalability and clarity:

* **Presentation Layer (Streamlit UI)**
  Handles user interaction and result display

* **State Layer**
  Manages session data across multiple steps

* **Processing Layer**
  Handles input cleaning and preparation

* **Embedding Layer (`embed.py`)**
  Converts text into vector representations

* **Retrieval Layer (`retriever.py`, `search.py`)**
  Fetches relevant policy data using FAISS

* **RAG Pipeline (`rag_pipeline.py`)**
  Integrates retrieval with AI reasoning

* **AI Layer (Groq API)**
  Generates eligibility decisions and explanations

## 🧑‍💻 Working Process

1. User enters required details
2. Data is stored using session state
3. Input is converted into embeddings
4. Relevant policies are retrieved from FAISS
5. Data is sent to Groq AI model
6. Model generates:
   * Eligibility decision
   * Explanation
7. Output is displayed in UI
